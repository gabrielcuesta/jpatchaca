2012/05/09 - Version 1.6
New worklog month view, 
Jira greasemonkey scripts and 
Pair programming remote integration 

(Task>Options>Keyboard Rotation>Sync with remote...)
Every time keyboard rotation is turned on a dialog will appear asking for the remote
host/ip, if provided remote time-tracker will be kept in sync with local, IE. both will 
have the same active task.

To install Greasemonkey scripts open the following links in your Google-Chrome or Firefox browser:
https://github.com/kalecser/jpatchaca/raw/master/greasemonkey/jira_integration.user.js
https://github.com/kalecser/jpatchaca/blob/master/greasemonkey/greenhopper_integration.user.js

Don't forget to check out the new Worklog month view so you can send all your months worklogs at once ;)
